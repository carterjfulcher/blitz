A lightning fast blockchain, with 1 billion transaction per day throughput capacity. 

### Thesis
- Visa and Mastercard combined do about 1 billion transactions per day. Bitcoin does about 400 thousand transactions per day, this is far too slow for a replacement.
- Blockchains are really just a large distributed compute problem
